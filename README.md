# Inspiration
Where did you spend the most times during the almost over two years pandemic? That's right, your bedroom. We wanted a way to illustrate what living in isolation was like for many students in Canada. We decided to showcase the positives amidst all the chaos but also the realism of the situation.

# What it does
RoomDemic is more than just bedroom — it is the epitome of your typical pandemic bedroom. The multiple objects in the room contain links that allow you to learn new skills, be up-to-date with news and even play games!

# How we built it
We split the work into two main parts: the home web page (RoomDemic) and a mini-game (PetTheDoge). RoomDemic was primarily written in HTML5 and CSS, but all the graphics were hand drawn by us with Procreate. PetTheDoge is a satire application meant to uplift the mood of the pandemic by combining memes and frustration. This was written in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

# Challenges we ran into
The graphics! We realized after brainstorming our idea that none of us knows how to draw. We had to bring out pencils and paints (virtual) and learn a new skill!

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We overcame many obstacles along the way that we did not foresee, such as a a teammate walking out on us on the first day of hacking. Nonetheless, we completed a project that we're proud of and learned a lot about programming aspects.

# What we learned
We learned how to work together and how to manage our time in a sustainable way. In addition, we experimented with new live sharing IDEs such as Replit.

# What's next for RoomDemic
Better graphics! Maybe try pixel arts!
